# Javascript Learning System
This is a multi-agent system designed to help users learn JavaScript in an interactive, chatbot-like environment. The system consists of specialized AI agents that work together to provide explanations, correct code, and validate solutions. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, this tool is here to assist you.
# System Architecture

The system consists of the following agents:
- **Manager Agent**: Analyzes user requests and delegates tasks to other agents.
- **Teacher Agent**: Provides explanations, examples, and exercises for learning.
- **Coder Agent**: Corrects JavaScript code without explanations.
- **Validator Agent**: Ensures the final output is accurate and error-free.

These agents collaborate to create an interactive and efficient learning experience.
